Also the EU has morphed to a creeping  political federal state no one signed up for this or very few . It is not the UK that is leaving the EU.

Very wrong indeed.\nA small country is very vulnerable. \nA medium size country can very easily push it around.\nEven medium size International company can easily push such country around.\n\nThat is why those companies want to divide the countries.\nThen the people have no shelter from them.\nIn a small country it does not matter who you vote for.\nYou will be manipulated by some outside force.
