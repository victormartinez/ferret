href="https://www.vanityfair.com/topic/harvey-weinstein#intcid=dt-hot-link">Harvey Weinstein</a></strong> is on the verge of being ostracized from the glittering circles he spent years building. On Thursday, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations">a shocking report</a> by <em>The New York Times</em> detailed numerous sexual harassment allegations that have been lobbed at the Weinstein Company head over nearly the last 30 years. Figures including <strong>Ashley Judd</strong> spoke on the record, while it was reported that women including <strong>Rose McGowan</strong> were paid settlements by Weinstein to avoid messy lawsuits that would publicly air his alleged behavior. Now the Democratic politicians Weinstein spent years courting are starting to pull away from him, re-routing his financial donations to charitable causes. Meanwhile, the board for the Weinstein Company is scheduled to meet this week to decide their figurehead&#x2019;s fate once and for all.</p><p data-reactid="219">According to <a href="http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/harvey-weinstein-patrick-leahy-1202581995/"><em>Variety</em></a>, politicians <strong>Sen. Patrick Leahy</strong> (D-Vt.) spurred the anti-Weinstein movement, announcing that he would give the movie producer&#x2019;s $2,700 campaign donation to charity. Per his spokesman, the money will now go to the &#x201C;Women&#x2019;s Fund at the Vermont Community Foundation, specifically the Change the Story Initiative.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="220"><strong>Sen. Martin Heinrich</strong> (D-N.M.) and <strong>Sen. Richard Blumenthal</strong> (D-Conn.) quickly followed suit, announcing that their Harvey-backed donations will also go to charity.</p><p data-reactid="221">&#x201C;Women shouldn&#x2019;t have to face sexual harassment at work,&#x201D; the Heinrich campaign said. &#x201C;Martin is giving Mr. Weinstein&#x2019;s donation to Community Against Violence.&#x201D;</p><div data-reactid="222"><div class="embed cneembed"><div class="embed block cneembed" data-url="//player.cnevids.com/script/video/59d282b8148bb03bb500000b.js"></div></div></div><p data-reactid="223">Heinrich had received $5,400 from Weinstein. Blumenthal, who received the same amount, will donate his portion to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence.</p><p data-reactid="224">Outside of Hollywood, Weinstein built a reputation as a strong Democratic supporter, donating at least $1.4 million to candidates, parties, and political action committees over the years, per <em>Variety.</em> The Republican National Committee has already seized on this fact, slamming Democrats for aligning themselves with a man known for predatory behavior. &#x201C;Democrats and the DNC truly stand up for women like they say they do, then returning this dirty money should be a no-brainer,&#x201D; chairwoman <strong>Ronna McDaniel</strong> said in a statement.</p><p data-reactid="225">Now that a few senators have stepped up to formally announce these donations, other politicians will likely come to the fore, responding to the pressure to quickly withdraw themselves from Weinstein&#x2019;s newly chaotic narrative. The Oscar winner was deeply embedded in political circles, throwing glitzy fund-raising events for <strong><a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/people/hillary-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> and palling around with <strong>Barack</strong> and <strong>Michelle Obama.</strong> <strong>Malia Obama,</strong> an aspiring filmmaker, even interned at the Weinstein Company.</p><div class="inline-subscribe-ad-container" data-reactid="226"></div><p data-reactid="227">The fallout has also breeched Weinstein&#x2019;s personal and professional life. The board of directors for the Weinstein Company, which he runs with his brother, <strong>Bob,</strong> is <a href="http://variety.com/2017/film/news/harvey-weinstein-bob-weinstein-1202581952/">reportedly having</a> a meeting this week to decide Harvey&#x2019;s future. In the wake of the report, Weinstein is currently taking a leave of absence from the company. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unclear if Weinstein will be suspended or forced out of the company entirely,&#x201D; <em>Variety</em> notes. &#x201C;He has an ownership stake in the studio that could complicate any moves to oust him.&#x201D;</p><p data-reactid="228">Through all this, Weinstein has not exactly remained silent. He released <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/us/statement-from-harvey-weinstein.html?src=twr&amp;_r=1">a rambling statement</a> to the <em>Times,</em> admitting that he used to behave in an unacceptable manner (without getting specific) even as his lawyer denied some of the accusations. His lawyers also announced that they plan to file a $50 million lawsuit against the <em>Times.</em> Weinstein then <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-new-york-times-sexual-harassment-ashley-judd-page-six">spoke</a> to Page Six, denying Ashley Judd&#x2019;s allegations against him and explaining the reason for the lawsuit. &#x201C;The reason I am suing is because of the <em>Times</em>&#x2019;s inability to be honest with me, and their reckless reporting,&#x201D; Weinstein said. &#x201C;They told me lies.&#x201D;</p><div class="component-newsletter-cta" data-reactid="229"><div class="component-newsletter-cta__hed" data-reactid="230">Get Vanity Fairâs HWD

Weinstein</a></strong> is on the verge of being ostracized from the glittering circles he spent years building. On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment-allegations\">a shocking report</a> by <em>The New York Times</em> detailed numerous sexual harassment allegations that have been lobbed at the Weinstein Company head over nearly the last 30 years. Figures including <strong>Ashley Judd</strong> spoke on the record, while it was reported that women including <strong>Rose McGowan</strong> were paid settlements by Weinstein to avoid messy lawsuits that would publicly air his alleged behavior. Now the Democratic politicians Weinstein spent years courting are starting to pull away from him, re-routing his financial donations to charitable causes. Meanwhile, the board for the Weinstein Company is scheduled to meet this week to decide their figurehead&#x2019;s fate once and for all.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>According to <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/politics/news/harvey-weinstein-patrick-leahy-1202581995/\"><em>Variety</em></a>, politicians <strong>Sen. Patrick Leahy</strong> (D-Vt.) spurred the anti-Weinstein movement, announcing that he would give the movie producer&#x2019;s $2,700 campaign donation to charity. Per his spokesman, the money will now go to the &#x201C;Women&#x2019;s Fund at the Vermont Community Foundation, specifically the Change the Story Initiative.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p><strong>Sen.

Blumenthal, who received the same amount, will donate his portion to the Connecticut Alliance to End Sexual Violence.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Outside of Hollywood, Weinstein built a reputation as a strong Democratic supporter, donating at least $1.4 million to candidates, parties, and political action committees over the years, per <em>Variety.</em> The Republican National Committee has already seized on this fact, slamming Democrats for aligning themselves with a man known for predatory behavior. &#x201C;Democrats and the DNC truly stand up for women like they say they do, then returning this dirty money should be a no-brainer,&#x201D; chairwoman <strong>Ronna McDaniel</strong> said in a statement.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Now that a few senators have stepped up to formally announce these donations, other politicians will likely come to the fore, responding to the pressure to quickly withdraw themselves from Weinstein&#x2019;s newly chaotic narrative. The Oscar winner was deeply embedded in political circles, throwing glitzy fund-raising events for <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/people/hillary-clinton#intcid=dt-hot-link\">Hillary Clinton</a></strong> and palling around with <strong>Barack</strong> and <strong>Michelle Obama.</strong> <strong>Malia Obama,</strong> an aspiring filmmaker, even interned at the Weinstein Company.</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>The fallout has also breeched Weinstein&#x2019;s personal and professional life. The board of directors for the Weinstein Company, which he runs with his brother, <strong>Bob,</strong> is <a href=\"http://variety.com/2017/film/news/harvey-weinstein-bob-weinstein-1202581952/\">reportedly having</a> a meeting this week to decide Harvey&#x2019;s future. In the wake of the report, Weinstein is currently taking a leave of absence from the company. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s unclear if Weinstein will be suspended or forced out of the company entirely,&#x201D; <em>Variety</em> notes. &#x201C;He has an ownership stake in the studio that could complicate any moves to oust him.&#x201D;</p>","isEmbed":false,"type":"p"},{"content":"<p>Through all this, Weinstein has not exactly remained silent.

His lawyers also announced that they plan to file a $50 million lawsuit against the <em>Times.</em> Weinstein then <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/harvey-weinstein-new-york-times-sexual-harassment-ashley-judd-page-six\">spoke</a> to Page Six, denying Ashley Judd&#x2019;s allegations against him and explaining the reason for the lawsuit. &#x201C;The reason I am suing is because of the <em>Times</em>&#x2019;s inability to be honest with me, and their reckless reporting,&#x201D; Weinstein said.

The choice made sense. Clinton was the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, traversing battleground states to shore up voters and delegates and sell the exact kinds of qualities that would make someone among Americansâ most respected people. That this was the 20th time that Clinton topped the list&#8212;since 1993&#8212;is a testament to the role she has played in the modern fabric of American politics. (Only Eleanor Roosevelt, with 13 years atop the list, and Margaret Thatcher, who bested the rest six times, come close to Clintonâs Gallup reign.)\n<p>To be sure, there are a good many Americans who do not feel such affection for Clinton. As First Lady for eight years, she forgave her husband, Bill, for cheating with an intern, covering up the affair, and being impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. After the Clintons left the White House for New York, she voted in favor of the Iraq war&#8212;a decision that has since raised questions about her hawkish judgement.

Character-driven late-night shows are an art form the network has honed with previous successes like <em>The Colbert Report</em> and <em>The President Show</em>&#8212;and now Klepper will join their ranks attempting to pull of what is, perhaps, the trickiest use of the gambit yet. Klepper has challenged himself with satirizing alternative-news sources like <em>Breitbart</em> and <em>InfoWars</em>&#8212;without mimicking them so closely that <em>The Opposition</em> itself becomes tiresome to exhausted audiences. Viewers already got a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/jordan-klepper-comedy-central-show-trailer-the-opposition\">whiff</a> of what the showâs formula might look like in a trailer, but in its first clip, <em>The Opposition</em> makes an immediately strong impression.</p>\n<p>From the looks of it, this show will be a sort of nouveau <em>Colbert Report</em> anchored by an exaggerated version of Klepperâs old <em>Daily Show</em> persona. This clip finds Klepper at a Trump rally in Phoenix&#8212;where, he notes, there is no shortage of reporters. âLook closely. Youâre gonna see a lot of cameras out there&#8212;and thatâs the mainstream media,â he warns before deadpanning, âDonât trust anyone whoâs talking to a camera.â</p>\n<p>What does his show oppose? The Resistance, of course&#8212;but <em>The Opposition</em>âs long list of enemies doesnât stop there. âWe are anti-mainstream,â Klepper explains. âAnti-Soros; anti-globalist; weâre anti-Oprahâs Book Club; weâre anti-pho. Not <em>antifa,</em> the movement&#8212;the Vietnamese soup.â For Klepper and his team, itâs all about exposing the hard truths&#8212;like the fact that <strong>Chuck Todd</strong> totally has a ponytail.</p>\n<p>As Klepper conducts man-on-the-street interviews, the clear influence of his <em>Daily Show</em> past is very much present. His <em>Daily Show</em> character was a privileged white dude with plenty of opinions but very little self-awareness; his <em>Opposition</em> character appears to use that as a starting point, but will also dial up the self-assuredness.</p>\n<p>And before he signs off, Klepper has one last trick up his sleeve: a petition to impeach <strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong> As the unsuspecting citizens he finds voice their support for this facetious movement&#8212;and, in some cases, even provide signatures&#8212;itâs hard not to think of Kimmelâs popular âLie Witness Newsâ segment, which have exposed <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/kimmel-trumpcare-lie-witness-news\">plenty of ignorance</a> within the population. Weâre guessing there will be more tricks where this one came from on <em>The Opposition,</em> which premieres September 25.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Television","tags":["the opposition","jordan klepper","comedy central","television"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"She may not be the president, but the host of Comedy Centralâs upcoming series <em>The Opposition</em> wonât let that stop him.","seoTitle":"Watch Jordan Klepper Go on a Mission to Impeach Hillary Clinton","seoDescription":"She may not be the president, but the host of Comedy Centralâs upcoming series The Opposition wonât let that stop him.","socialTitle":"Watch Jordan Klepper Go on a Mission to Impeach Hillary Clinton","socialDescription":"She may not be the president, but the host of Comedy Centralâs upcoming series The Opposition wonât let that stop him.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Coming Soon","promoHed":"Watch Jordan Klepper Go on a Mission to Impeach Hillary Clinton","promoDek":"She may not be the president, but the host of Comedy Centralâs upcoming series <em>The Opposition</em> wonât let that stop him.","id":"59b830ad7791672288d5209e","revision":9,"createdAt":"September 12, 2017 3:08 pm","modifiedAt":"September 12, 2017 4:09 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 12, 2017 4:09 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Laura Bradley","filename":"the-opposition-jordan-klepper-comedy-central-clip.png","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1620,"height":1080,"format":"PNG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/12/59b83a16638e524b7f0da688_the-opposition-jordan-klepper-comedy-central-clip.png"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1080,"width":1620,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1080,"width":1620,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":972,"width":1620,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":972,"width":1620,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1080,"width":720,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1080,"width":720,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1072,"width":603,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1072,"width":603,"x":508.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":693,"width":1617,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":693,"width":1617,"x":1.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":909,"width":1616,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":909,"width":1616,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1080,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1080,"width":1440,"x":90,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1080,"width":1080,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1080,"width":1080,"x":270,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"the-opposition-jordan-klepper-comedy-central-clip.png","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59b83a16a0ab974b7f514c86","revision":0,"createdAt":"September 12, 2017 3:48 pm","modifiedAt":"September 12, 2017 3:48 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 12, 2017 3:48 pm","modelName":"photo","altText":""}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Chiara Marinai","name":"Laura Bradley","bio":"Laura Bradley is a Hollywood writer for VanityFair.com.

And I had a lot of liberal friends who were like, âSheâs not good at this.â And I see that, and I understand it.

Its Title for All the Wrong Reasons","body":"<section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>There was a good case for sitting this one out. Iâve said plenty about <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> over the <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/can-hillary-clinton-please-go-quietly-into-the-night\">past couple of years</a>, some of it quite critical, and reflections on <em>What Happened,</em> Clintonâs new book about her loss in the 2016 election, arenât scarce. Plus I havenât read it. Okay, Iâve read a lot of it, but itâs long, so thereâs been a lot of skimming. On the other hand, when you write a book, youâre asking for a conversation. Whatâs more, Iâve read books that are far worse, such as Clintonâs previous books. (Sorry, <em>Hard Choices</em> fans.) By contrast, this one is readable, lively, at times candid, and, above all, useful. At a time when Democrats canât quite decide whether to pore over what happened in 2016 or bury the debate and move on, Clinton has invited people to do the former.</p>\n<p>Hillary shows a charming generosity in sharing her inner thoughts and the mundane details of her life, like what her bedroom looks like. Thereâs also, it should be said, evidence of a politician in mid-transition back to human. Disarming accounts of her actions are often paired with an explanation of the moral of the story or the virtue embodied, even when itâs obvious. We all know that Hillary Clinton is a monument to perseverance, for instance, but so does she, and she tells us so. (Harriet Tubmanâs directive to âkeep goingâ is also quoted.) One of the curses of the politician is that no inner chamber of virtue is left hidden or undisturbed. Like archaeologists extracting artifacts from a tomb, politicians and their teams tend to dig up everything that can be perceived as shiny and, to gain approval, put it on display. Itâs habit.</p>\n<p>Literature is full of unreliable narrators, many of them intelligent and perceptive, and reading Hillary Clinton is sometimes reminiscent of a <strong>Julian Barnes</strong> novel. So much of what she says is self-aware and thoughtful that the blind spots can take you by surprise. For instance, Clinton clearly worked much harder than anyone realized to gauge the mood of the public, seeking the sort of ground-level information thatâs so hard to get when youâre in the campaign bubble. At the same time, she writes that the picture of American suffering painted by <strong>Donald Trump</strong> was one she âdidnât recognizeâ in contrast to the âenergy and optimism I saw when I traveled around the country.â Surely, one thinks, she must be aware of selection bias.</p>\n<p>Clinton has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/05/31/clinton-im-not-going-anywhere.html\">told</a> N.P.R. that sheâs ânot going anywhereâ and that she intends to remain a player in Democratic politics. Iâve already <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/can-hillary-clinton-please-go-quietly-into-the-night\">presented a case</a> for why sheâd help the country more by letting go of the reins, so I wonât revisit it. I also wonât get to even a tenth of the stuff in Clintonâs book that would be fun to discuss. Instead, Iâll try to address three concerns that came to mind when reading her narrative, because they extend beyond considerations of Hillary Clinton. The penumbra of respectable opinion is always shifting in one direction or another, according to the whims of the Acela corridor, but its movements are slow enough that those who are borne along with it experience a smooth ride. Clinton dwells near its core, as do most college-educated blue-state Americans, and that means that her arguments about why she lost arenât just her arguments. Theyâre those of a powerful plurality of Americans, and they suggest, at least from the vantage point of this writer, some critical blind spots.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/580e6ed6fd2e615259000040.js?muted=1\"></div></div></section><section class=\"content-section\" data-type=\"section\"><p>One of the most common complaints people voiced about Donald Trump from the start was that he offered no solutions, only provocation. âI was giving speeches laying out how to solve the countryâs problems,â Clinton writes. âHe was ranting on Twitter.â Similar sentiments were echoed by everyone from <strong>Jeb Bush</strong> to <strong>Barack Obama,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.today.com/video/obama-donald-trump-doesn-t-seem-to-have-any-plans-or-specific-solutions-733037635959\">argued</a> that Trump didnât âseem to have any plans or policies or proposals or specific solutions.â</p>\n<p>If you re-read Trumpâs <a href=\"http://time.com/3923128/donald-trump-announcement-speech/\">speech</a> announcing his candidacy, however, youâll see he spoke of revisiting trade deals and controlling illegal immigration, and his proposals included a 35-percent tariff and a border wall. He also advocated infrastructure spending and suggested invasions of foreign countries should be undertaken only if the United States planned to cart off their oil. You could make a case that these policies were dangerous or immoral. But you couldnât claim they were non-existent and wave them away.</p>\n<p>Snow blindness in response to the glare of radical policy ideas is a common phenomenon. During the Democratic primaries of 1972, the <em>New York Times</em> editorial board described the populist and recent segregationist George Wallace as a candidate who was âexploiting issues, not solving problems,â even though Wallace was running on a perfectly clear platform of speedy withdrawal from Vietnam, increased Social Security benefits, cessation of foreign aid, taxation of church-owned commercial property, and new labor protections, among other things. In later elections, <strong>Jesse Jackson</strong> on the left and <strong>Pat Buchanan</strong> on the right drew similar accusations, sometimes simultaneously. While neither lacked a long list of policy ideas, both were deemed guilty of using words âto inflame, not enlighten,â as one Claremont McKenna College political scientist <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-02-16/news/9602160334_1_pat-buchanan-establishment-attacks-buchanan-religious-conservatives\">told</a> the <em>Chicago Tribune.</em> Trumpâs foes tended to fall into a similar trap.</p>\n<p>The second Clinton blind spot concerns the rage of her own side. âI couldnât&#8212;and wouldnât&#8212;compete to stoke peopleâs rage and resentment,â she writes. Of course, to describe opponents as âresentfulâ or âangryâ is a common approach to delegitimizing their views. Many of us will recall how Republicans tut-tutted over the âangerâ shown by Democrats toward <strong>George W. Bush</strong> in 2004, as if Bush didnât deserve it and anger were in itself discrediting. And if the intention is to frame things prejudicially to help your side, then such an approach is fine, or at least well within the conventional political toolkit. But itâs different if you believe your own copy, which Clinton seems to.</p>\n<p>The risk here is that Democrats will decide to get into an arms race over rage-stoking at a time when people are already excessively riled, and not only because of Trump. While Trump capitalized on white grievance, an ominous development, it worked in part because Democrats had been cavalier about capitalizing on non-white grievance. One especially troubling decision they made was to try to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/31/us/politics/at-risk-in-senate-democrats-seek-to-rally-blacks.html\">harness</a> the racial anger in Ferguson, Missouri, in order to boost Democratic turnout for the 2014 midterms. You can argue that they were merely doing what all politicians do&#8212;offering a remedy for injustice&#8212;but thereâs a difference between seeking justice and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/lawmakers-ferguson-hands-up-113254\">contributing</a> to the spread of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/03/16/lesson-learned-from-the-shooting-of-michael-brown/?utm_term=.fa476224b73a\">debunked narratives</a>. Perhaps, when Trump has left office, we can find a way to call a truce on rage.</p>\n<p>The third permeating trait of Clintonâs account is its confidence in being on the lonely side of âreality.â Clinton dismisses the political beliefs of Trump supporters as the product of a âpartisan petri dish where science is denied, lies masquerade as truth, and paranoia flourishes.â She isnât all wrong, but the risk of hubris is great. Clinton seems to underestimate how guided she is by what might be called The Narrative, the collection of lore that our intellectual establishment enshrines at any given time. The point isnât that both sides are equal in partisan blindness&#8212;thatâs a separate discussion&#8212;but, rather, that nothing good can come of letting down your guard just because the other side has gotten screwy from watching Fox. (And, yes, Fox does seem to have that effect eventually.) Democrats wonât win over voters if they think of themselves as the guardians of reality and everyone else as the victim of a delusional spell.</p>\n<p>There is, of course, much else to address in Clintonâs book. Weâll have rousing&#8212;or perhaps just bruising&#8212;disputes over <strong>Vladimir Putin,</strong> the F.B.I., identity politics, liberalism, neo-liberalism, <strong><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-single-payer\">Bernie Sanders,</a></strong> and many other topics brought up by <em>What Happened.</em> But thatâs why itâs good Clinton wrote it. Thereâs always the question of Hillary Clinton the person, and this book shows her to be just like Hillary Clinton, only more so, meaning that youâll love it or hate it or feel however you already felt about its author. But the question of where Democrats and the left go from here can only be answered with an account of how we got here, which is why we should be grateful for Clintonâs important, if decidedly imperfect, answer.</p>\n</section>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["politics","hillary clinton","what happened","book"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Literature is full of unreliable narrators, many of them intelligent and perceptive, and reading <em>What Happened</em> is sometimes reminiscent of a Julian Barnes novel.

First, <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong> <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/09/clinton-what-happened-election-colbert-late-show-naked-men\">presented her</a> with a parade of naked man-butts, branded with the words âIâm with Her.â And then, during her visit to <em>The Tonight Show</em> on Wednesday night, <strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong> temporarily vacated his desk so that the showâs female writers&#8212;plus special week-long guest <strong>Miley Cyrus</strong>&#8212;could write her a series of heartfelt thank-you notes. Those notes are a recurring segment on the show, but this was probably the most touching edition of the bit yet.</p>\n<p>The expressions of gratitude kicked off with pure sincerity. As one writer said, âThank you, Hillary Clinton, for handling this transition with more grace than I ever could have imagined. That being said, call me day or night and I will be there with a gallon of ice cream and two spoons to tell you, âGirl, you are so much better than him!ââ</p>\n<p>Of course, the jokes started coming faster and faster as the segment continued, including gems like this one: âThank you, Hillary, for all the work youâve done for public health care; ever since the election, Iâve really depended on my government-subsidized anti-anxiety medication.â Or this one: âThank you, Hillary, for remaining strong and showing poise before, during, and especially after the election. You taught me that when dealing with a difficult defeat, itâs O.K. to take time to reflect, set your focus on a new path forward, and maybe find a cave in the woods to scream into.â O.K., just one more, because why not? âThank you, Hillary, for always sticking to the issues even as people criticize you for superficial things like your hair, your wardrobe, and your appearance. You show girls everywhere that politics isnât a popularity contest&#8212;because if it were, you would have won by about 3 million votes.â</p>\n<p>And then, toward the end, came Cyrus, who struggled to hold back tears as she delivered her own note. âThank you, Hillary, for being a constant beacon of strength, hope, and determination for me and millions of other young women. Youâve been a role model and an inspiration and a voice of reason in uncertain times. I could go on and on, but Iâd like to get right to the point. Can I give you a hug?â</p>\n<p>Clinton said yes, of course, and after the two hugged she delivered a gracious thought of her own&#8212;and, true to form, it involved an ever-so-<em>slightly</em> stale pop-culture reference: âThank you, Miley, the <em>Tonight Show</em> writers, and all of the women and young girls out there. You are smart, strong, and deserving of every opportunity. Together, weâve made our voices heard; weâve done great things; and weâve come a long way.

When Colbert pointed out the harsh criticism Clinton has received since the election, including <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/06/can-hillary-clinton-please-go-quietly-into-the-night\">pleas for her to go away</a>, Clinton had a swift response.</p>\n<p>âWell, you know, if they take up a collection and send me somewhere <em>really</em> nice, I might consider it,â she said.</p>\n<p>âObama is on <strong>David Geffenâs</strong> yacht a lot; you could go with him,â Colbert suggested.</p>\n<p>âI am not going anywhere,â Clinton replied.</p>\n<p>Neither, for that matter, are the manspreaders.

Congratulations to our incredible cast,â she added. But just as McKinnon started to thank <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> for her âgrace and grit,â the orchestra kicked in&#8212;prompting McKinnon to hastily switch to thanking her mom.

McKinnon may have won for gracefully carrying her popular Clinton impression through a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/snl-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-debate\">tumultuous</a> (and at times <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/11/snl-hillary-clinton-hallelujah-kate-mckinnon\">emotionally devastating</a>) election season alone. But the way in which she pivoted, post-election, to nimbly skewer other members of the Trump administration, like <strong>Kellyanne Conway,</strong> <strong>Betsy DeVos,</strong> and <strong>Jeff Sessions,</strong> proved that, imported talent like <strong>Alec Baldwin</strong> and fellow Emmy winner <strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong> aside, McKinnon remains the showâs most valuable player.</p>\n<p>Her back-to-back wins also makes some Emmys history for <em>S.N.L.,</em> which has actually seen very few of its regular players nominated (let alone win) in its 42 seasons on air. McKinnonâs double win joins single wins for previous cast members <strong>Chevy Chase</strong> (1976), Gilda Radner (1978), and <strong>Dana Carvey</strong> (1993). And thatâs it for the permanent cast! The show usually fares better in the star-studded guest acting category, where hosts like <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong> and <strong>Betty White</strong> have picked up statues. In recent years, with the exception of back-to-back nominations for <strong>Bill Hader</strong> in 2012 and 2013, itâs been the women of <em>S.N.L.</em> representing the cast on Emmys night. Former cast members <strong>Amy Poehler</strong> and <strong>Kristen Wiig</strong> scored three and six nominations, respectively, but this year, the supporting-actress category was crowded with <em>three</em> female <em>S.N.L.</em> players: McKinnon, her fellow Ghostbuster <strong>Leslie Jones,</strong> and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/sasheer-zamata-snl-leaving-bobby-moynihan-vanessa-bayer\">departing cast member</a> <strong>Vanessa Bayer.</strong> Not bad for a show that once had to make light of its lack of female players during a <a href=\"https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7o2ca_twin-peaks-parody-by-saturday-night_fun\">1990 <em>Twin Peaks</em> sketch</a>, in which the only two women in the cast&#8212;Jan Hooks and <strong>Victoria Jackson</strong> &#8212;had to breathlessly play every female character opposite guest host <strong>Kyle MacLachlan.</strong> âThereâs only two women left on <em>Saturday Night Live,</em>â <strong>Kevin Nealon</strong> ruefully admitted in character as Sheriff Truman, âand we already used them both up.â</p>\n<div class=\"callout small\" data-type=\"callout\"></div><p>That was during the season where featured players <strong>Adam Sandler, David Spade,</strong> Chris Farley, and <strong>Rob Schneider</strong> joined existing stars <strong>Mike Myers</strong> and <strong>Dana Carvey</strong> to usher in <em>S.N.L.</em>âs most frat-boy-friendly era. Itâs been a few decades since that particular lineup, but last season, <em>S.N.L.</em> took a very conscious step away from that brand of humor. Removing <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/08/saturday-night-live-gay-jokes-kate-mckinnon\">somewhat controversial</a> cast members <strong>Taran Killam</strong> and <strong>Jon Rudnitsky</strong> (as well as <strong>Jay Pharoah,</strong> who recently claimed he <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/jay-pharoah-snl\">refused to wear a dress</a> in a sketch under any circumstances), <em>S.N.L.</em> hired <strong>Chris Kelly</strong> and <strong>Sarah Schneider</strong> as head writers. The team of Kelly and Schneider represented not only the first openly gay and the third female head writer in the showâs history, respectively, but also the perfect opportunity for the women of <em>S.N.L.</em> to take an even more central role in the cast as McKinnon was eager to note in her speech: âThank you to our amazing writers. Itâs all about the writing guys. Especially Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, I love you guys so much.â</p>\n<p>While itâs true that imported talent Baldwin and McCarthy, as well as rising star <strong>Mikey Day</strong> (âDavid S. Pumpkinsâ), deserve credit for this brilliant season, the unabashedly progressive politics of the show overall were its most recognizable calling card. And even before they became head writers, Kelly and Schneider used their positions on the writing staff to showcase female talent. In a 2015 interview with <em><a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/11/20/snl-writers-chris-kelly-sarah-schneider-interview\">Entertainment Weekly</a>,</em> the writing duo cited <strong>Aidy Bryant</strong> and Kate McKinnon as their most frequent collaborators, and Schneider said, âWe like to write for women and the cast of women that we currently have is incredible. It feels fortuitous for us that we get to be here at a time when the people we like to write for are really killing it on the show.â</p>\n<p>During their tenure on the show, Kelly and Schneider were responsible for a string of hit girl-band music-video sketches â<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3twGmSu1MI0\">First Got Horny 2 U</a>,â â<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmWH1F-caM8\">Back Home Ballers</a>,â and â<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-QG-rFf4po\">(Do It on My) Twin Bed</a>â&#8212;and, this year, added the enormously popular â<a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/melania-trump-beyonce-melanianade-saturday-night-live\">Melanianade</a>,â featuring guest host <strong>Emily Blunt</strong> as <strong>Ivanka Trump,</strong> Kate McKinnon as Kellyanne Conway, <strong>Sasheer Zamata</strong> as <strong>Omarosa,</strong> and <strong>Vanessa Bayer</strong> as <strong>Tiffany Trump</strong>&#8212;to the list.</p>\n<p>The women of <em>S.N.L.</em> were also deployed throughout the season to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/10/saturday-night-live-jost-che-weekend-update-hillary-clinton-donald-trump\">occasionally skewer and shred</a> the perspectives of their own male co-stars like âWeekend Updateâ hosts <strong>Colin Jost</strong> and <strong>Michael Che.</strong> Itâs true that Baldwinâs Trump was something of a lynchpin this season, but <em>S.N.L.</em>âs renewed role as the comedic voice of the left wouldnât have been nearly as successful without a cast full of women ready to react to his antics with shock, dismay, and, snarling disdain. Having <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/01/snl-diversity-oscars-so-white-parody-bachelor\">significantly improved</a> diversity among its cast these last few years (though it still hasnât announced a replacement for Zamata), <em>S.N.L.</em> was  perfectly primed to be more gay, female, and viral-friendly under the stewardship of Schneider and Kelly. As it turns out, that was <em>exactly</em> what the country needed.</p>","channel":"Hollywood","subChannel":"Award Season","tags":["emmys","kate mckinnon"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"McKinnonâs Emmy win proves how women made <em>S.N.L.</em> great again this year.","seoTitle":"Kate McKinnonâs Emmy Speech Abruptly Cut Off as She Thanks Hillary Clinton","seoDescription":"McKinnonâs Emmy win proves how women made S.N.L. great again this year.","socialTitle":"Kate McKinnonâs Emmy Speech Abruptly Cut Off as She Thanks Hillary Clinton","socialDescription":"McKinnonâs Emmy win proves how women made S.N.L. great again this year.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Emmys 2017","promoHed":"Kate McKinnonâs Emmy Speech Abruptly Cut Off as She Thanks Hillary Clinton","promoDek":"McKinnonâs Emmy win proves how women made <em>S.N.L.</em> great again this year.","id":"59bec49b3c835b0539799dc5","revision":54,"createdAt":"September 17, 2017 2:53 pm","modifiedAt":"September 18, 2017 10:38 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 18, 2017 10:38 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Kenzie Bryant","filename":"hillary-clinton-kate-mckinnon-dinner.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1440,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":1440,"height":960}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":1440,"height":864,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":0,"width":1440,"height":864}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":534,"height":801,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":247,"y":79,"height":801,"width":534}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":540,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":590,"y":0,"height":960,"width":540}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1435,"height":615,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":2,"y":0,"width":1435,"height":615}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1440,"height":810,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":0,"y":40,"height":810,"width":1440}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1279,"height":959,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":45,"y":0,"height":959,"width":1279}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":960,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":180,"y":0,"height":960,"width":960}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/02/17/58a71cdf73f47a265c03fd4f_hillary-clinton-kate-mckinnon-dinner.jpg","width":1440,"height":960,"duration":null}},"title":"NUP_171046_0072.JPG","credit":"","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"58a71ce073f47a265c03fd50","revision":1,"createdAt":"February 17, 2017 10:55 am","modifiedAt":"February 17, 2017 10:55 am","revisionCreatedAt":"February 17, 2017 10:55 am","tags":[],"altText":"NUP_171046_0072.JPG","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"bio":"Joanna Robinson is a Hollywood writer covering TV and film for VanityFair.com.

Not Impressed by Universeâs Cruel Sense of Irony","body":"<p>After <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> left her job as secretary of state and before she âofficiallyâ decided to run for president, she gave a series of paid speeches at investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. If you remember hearing about them, itâs probably because they were <em>Exhibit A</em> in <strong>Donald Trumpâs</strong> case against âCrooked Hillary,â alongside The E-mails (<em>Exhibit B</em>). The speeches were proof, according to Trump, that Goldman Sachs had â<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/30/wall-street-basher-trump-loving-goldman-guys-for-his-team.html\">total control</a>â over his opponent and that she was therefore unfit for the highest office in the land. Absent the actual details of what Clinton said, it was easy enough for Trump&#8212;not to mention <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong>&#8212;to insinuate that Clinton had colluded with Wall Street to sell ordinary Americans up the river and <em>must have</em> told everyone in the audience they could count on her to screw over the little guy once in office.</p>\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/10/hillary-clinton-leaked-wall-street-speeches\">as leaked transcripts revealed last fall</a>, Clinton <em>obviously</em> didnât say any of that. Her dry, conventional speeches indicated only that she understood how Wall Street works and how to encourage industry participants to be proactive in rooting out bad behavior. Still, getting paid $225,000 a pop in the wake of the financial crisis&#8212;and likely knowing she was going to run for office a fews years later&#8212;wasnât the <em>best</em> look, as Clinton herself admits in her new election postmortem, <em>What Happened.</em></p>\n<p>âMy opponents spun wild tales about what terrible things I must have said behind closed doors and how as president I would be forever in the pocket of the shadowy bankers who had paid my speaking fees. I should have seen that coming,â Clinton writes in excerpts <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-10/clinton-done-with-being-a-candidate-as-she-recalls-2016-errors\">obtained</a> by Bloomberg. âWhen you know why youâre doing something and you know thereâs nothing more to it and certainly nothing sinister, itâs easy to assume that others will see it the same way.â Ultimately, she says, she realized the speeches were âa mistake.â âJust because many former government officials have been paid large fees to give speeches, I shouldnât have assumed it would be okay for me to do it. Especially after the financial crisis of 2008-2009, I should have realized it would be bad âopticsâ and stayed away from anything having to do with Wall Street. I didnât. Thatâs on me.â</p>\n<p>Some have encouraged Clinton to move on. Others suggest she shouldnât have written <em>What Happened</em> in the first place. But there are <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/people-clinton-blames-for-her-election-loss\">certain indignities that Clinton, apparently, cannot forgive</a>&#8212;including, but not limited to, slights by Sanders, <strong>Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin,</strong> and <strong>James Comey,</strong> all of whom receive their share of criticism for Clintonâs loss. Among the most galling, for Clinton, was Trumpâs whiplash-fast about-face from populist crusader to . . . hiring half a dozen people from Goldman Sachs. One minute he was criticizing Clinton and <strong>Ted Cruz</strong> for their ties to Goldman Sachs and accusing <strong>Lloyd Blankfein</strong> of being part of a âglobal power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working classâ; the next minute he was naming a former Goldman partner his Treasury secretary and poaching its second-most-powerful employee for chief economic adviser.</p>\n<p>For the people who actually believed the ex-Miss Universe owner, who never misses an opportunity to brag about how rich he is, was actually <em>serious</em> about the populist, anti-Wall Street themes he shouted from the lectern, that must have come as a shock. For Clinton, the turnaround generated another emotion: unbridled rage.</p>\n<p>âWhen I read the news that he filled his team with Wall Street bankers after relentlessly accusing me of being their stooge, I nearly threw the remote control at the wall.â</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>S&amp;P hits record high as Irma proves to be merely terrible, not cataclysmic</strong></p>\n<p>For the last five days, Hurricane Irma has ripped through the Caribbean and Florida, destroying islands, leaving millions without power, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/irma-leaves-dead-florida-37-dead-caribbean-millions/story?id=49758372\">killing at least 44 people</a>, and displacing many more who will be unable to return home any time soon. Those are objectively horrible outcomes. But for investors, the fact that it was expected to be significantly worse, but wasnât, was cause for celebration. On Monday, the S&amp;P 500 rose 1.1 percent to close at a record 2,488.11, while the Dow Jones climbed 259.58 points to close at 22,057.37. âWe think Hurricane Irma could be a top 5 most costly hurricane in the U.S, although the losses could be in-line-to-lower than market expectations,â JPMorgan analyst <strong>Sarah DeWitt</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/11/north-korea-oil-hurricanes-on-the-agenda-for-wall-street.html\">wrote</a> in a note to clients on Monday.</p>\n<p>Also helping turn things positive was the decision by North Korean dictator <strong>Kim Jong Un</strong> <em>not</em> to mark the countryâs anniversary over the weekend by launching a missile or dropping a hydrogen bomb. âThat North Korea didnât do anything, on a weekend they knew our country was going to be in flux because of hurricanes, is the primary reason weâre seeing this big rally,â market strategist <strong>JJ Kinahan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-markets-rise-after-quiet-weekend-1505097744\">told</a> <em>The Wall Street Journal.</em> âThe market has gone back up to where we were in early August before these North Korea fears.â</p>\n<p><strong>Is Ivanka Trump on Team Yellen?</strong></p>\n<p>If youâre <strong>Gary Cohn,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/yellen-ivanka-trump-had-breakfast-meeting-as-fed-race-heated-up\">this has got to hurt</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Federal Reserve Chair <strong>Janet Yellen</strong> and President Donald Trumpâs daughter and adviser Ivanka had a breakfast meeting on July 17 at the U.S. central bank, according to Yellenâs public schedule, posted earlier this month on the Fed website. Eight days after their one-hour meeting in a private dining room at the Fed, the president told the Wall Street Journal that Yellen was âin the running, absolutely,â for a second term as chair.

Meetings occasionally last for hours, sometimes simply because of a debate over why certain subjects are on the agenda or the quality of an employeeâs presentation.

where <strong>Melania</strong> is leading a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/melania-trump-speaks-on-cyberbullying-at-united-nations\">campaign against cyberbullying</a>; where lobbyists are put in charge of swamp-draining, Wall Street is encouraged to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/trump-administration-wants-wall-street-to-self-report-its-crimes\">regulate itself</a>, and <strong>Steve Mnuchin</strong> and <strong>Tom Price</strong> are <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/tom-price-private-planes\">using the government as a frequent-flyers club</a>. So it is perhaps unsurprising that one of Trumpâs signature campaign issues&#8212;the dangerous, corrupt, and unethical use of private e-mail by top-level government employees&#8212;is also a fixture of the presidentâs administration. According to multiple news reports, at least six of Trumpâs closest advisers&#8212;<strong>Reince Priebus, Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, Ivanka Trump, Gary Cohn,</strong> and <strong>Jared Kusher</strong>&#8212;have been using or <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/private-email-use-has-been-widespread-trumps-white-house\">used private e-mail accounts to conduct government business</a>.</p>\n<p>This revelation has not sat well with <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> whose infamous use of a private e-mail server as secretary of state led her to be vilified by Republicans, constantly denounced by Trump, investigated by the F.B.I., smeared by <strong>James Comey,</strong> and ultimately likely cost her the 2016 presidential election.</p>\n<p>âThe hypocrisy of this administration, who knew there was no real scandal, who knew that there was no basis for all their hyperventilating. Republican members of Congress who politicized the deaths in Benghazi,â Clinton <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/26/hillary-clinton-trump-administration-private-email-243143\">said</a> Monday in an interview on SiriusXM radio. âNo, weâre finding with the latest revelationsâthey didnât mean any of it. Itâs just the height of hypocrisy.â</p>\n<p>In the years leading up to November 2016, the G.O.P. repeatedly hammered at Clintonâs use of a private e-mail server, set up in her New York homeâs basement, to conduct sensitive business as secretary of state, culminating in the oft-repeated Trump rally chant, âLock her up!â While it appears that none of Trumpâs associates used private e-mail as frequently, the practice would have exposed them to the same alleged national security risks&#8212;and the same criticism. According to Politico, Ivanka and Kushner both <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/jared-kushner-private-email-white-house-243071\">set up a private family e-mail domain</a> shortly before moving to Washington, and that they used it to talk about government-related matters with both White House employees&#8212;Bannon, Cohn, and Priebus chief among them&#8212;and acquaintances outside the White House. (âKushnerâs representatives declined to detail the server or security measures on it.â)</p>\n<p>That practice was apparently so ârampantâ that Priebus previously <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/25/trump-white-house-email-personal-243129\">tried to crack down</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During a July senior staff meeting, Priebus asked aides to either store their personal phones in secure lockers in the White House or leave them at home during the workday, according to people who attended. The administration subsequently installed additional lockers, typically found only outside secure rooms, in the West Wing, as part of an effort to force aides to use their White House accounts for communications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the request was largely ignored, according to six current and former administration officials, advisers and others who correspond with the White House. Aides shrugged off Priebusâ request, and senior officials&#8212;including occasionally Priebus&#8212;continued to use their personal phones for phone calls, text messages, and e-mails for White House matters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thanks to the Presidential Records Act, all official government-related business must be conducted over White House e-mail accounts in order to preserve government communications, and circumventing that by using personal e-mail could possibly lead to legal action. Failure to adhere to the law could be particularly problematic for Kushner, who is a central figure in the Justice Departmentâs ongoing Russia investigation. (A spokesperson for Kushner <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/jared-kushner-private-email-white-house-243071\">told Politico</a> that while he had a private e-mail account, Kushner would forward any government-related communications âwhen someone [else] initiated the exchangeâ to his government account, and sent âfewer than 100 e-mails from January through August.â White House press secretary <strong>Sarah Huckabee Sanders</strong> said during a briefing Monday that Kushnerâs use of a private e-mail was, âto my knowledge, very limited.â)</p>\n<p>Already, lawmakers are threatening to investigate. Even the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee, which had gone after Clinton repeatedly and once held her in an eight-hour hearing over her serverâs role in the Benghazi attacks, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/25/jared-kushner-private-email-investigation-243117?lo=ap_e1\">sent a letter to the White House</a> demanding that they turn over details of those communications to Congress. âWith numerous public revelations of senior executive branch employees deliberately trying to circumvent these laws by using personal, private, or alias email addresses to conduct official government business, the Committee has aimed to use its oversight and investigative resources to prevent and deter misuse of private forms of written communication,â wrote Republican Rep. <strong>Trey Gowdy,</strong> the chair of the committee, alongside ranking Democrat <strong>Elijah Cummings.</strong></p>\n<p>The last time the committee made a similar records request in March, an administration official <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/25/jared-kushner-private-email-investigation-243117?lo=ap_e1\">responded</a> that âthere are no senior officials covered by the [Presidential Records Act] with multiple accounts.â That, it now turns out, was not true. Clinton, presumably, is not holding her breath waiting for an apology.</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/57fae1f4fd2e617aaa000002.js?muted=1\"></div></div>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["Hillary Clinton","Benghazi","e-mails","Jared Kushner"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"At least half a dozen White House aides have been doing the very thing that got Clinton investigated by the F.B.I.","seoTitle":"Clinton Seethes as Trump Staffers Caught Using Private E-Mail","seoDescription":"At least half a dozen White House aides have been doing the very thing that got Clinton investigated by the F.B.I.","socialTitle":"Clinton Seethes as Trump Staffers Caught Using Private E-Mail","socialDescription":"At least half a dozen White House aides have been doing the very thing that got Clinton investigated by the F.B.I.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Benghazi","promoHed":"Clinton Seethes as Trump Staffers Caught Using Private E-Mail","promoDek":"At least half a dozen White House aides have been doing the very thing that got Clinton investigated by the F.B.I.","id":"59ca63b07e77930c8a69435e","revision":7,"createdAt":"September 26, 2017 10:26 am","modifiedAt":"September 26, 2017 11:29 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 26, 2017 11:29 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Tina Nguyen","filename":"Clinton-Trump-Email.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1543,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/26/59ca63933d8edb5fbd6dbfac_Clinton-Trump-Email.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":0.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":1.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":428.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":483.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":1.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":3.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":85.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"NUP_179917_0001.jpg","credit":"By Nathan Congleton/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59ca63933d8edb5fbd6dbfad","revision":1,"createdAt":"September 26, 2017 10:26 am","modifiedAt":"September 26, 2017 10:26 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 26, 2017 10:26 am","tags":[],"altText":"Clinton stops by the Today show on September 13th.","description":"Getty;

But no 2016 foe apparently occupies so much of Clintonâs headspace as Senator <strong>Bernie Sanders,</strong> the Democratic socialist from Vermont who, she argues, hijacked the Democratic primary and derailed her White House bid by misleading voters with his utopian, pie-in-the-sky proposals for free health care, free college, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itsAdamJSmith/status/904760270102425601\">free ponies</a> for all. âThroughout the primaries, every time I wanted to hit back against Bernieâs attacks, I was told to restrain myself,â Clinton writes, comparing Sanders at one point to the deranged hitchhiker in <em>Thereâs Something About Mary.</em> âNoting that his plans didnât add up, that they would inevitably mean raising taxes on middle-class families, or that they were little more than a pipe-dream&#8212;all this could be used to reinforce the argument that I wasnât a true progressive.â</p>\n<p>The frustration has continued to weigh on her, nearly a year after losing the presidency to <strong>Donald Trump.</strong> And in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/hillarys-best-bernie-bashing-2484334526.html\">string of media appearances</a> over the past week, Clinton has doubled down on her criticism of Sanders. During an <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/13/16297454/hillary-clinton-single-payer-vox-interview\">interview</a> with Voxâs <strong>Ezra Klein</strong> on Tuesday, the former secretary of state said that while she supports opening up Medicare, Sandersâs plans for a single-payer system have been unrealistic and devoid of details. âAs you might remember, during the campaign he introduced a single-payer bill every year he was in Congress&#8212;and when somebody finally read it, he couldnât explain it and couldnât really tell people how much it was going to cost,â she said, arguing that the tax increases would likely be an insurmountable obstacle and noting that a similar plan had failed in Vermont. She continued the criticism in an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/hillarys-best-bernie-bashing-2484334526.html\">interview</a> with <em>Pod Save America,</em> complaining that Sandersâs indefensible claims âfilled up a lot of spaceâ during the Democratic primary and that it was âchallenging to have a straightforward argumentâ about health care. âBecause he would say: âOh, weâre going to do single-payer.â And Iâd say, âWell, how are you going to do it?â And he wouldnât know.â</p>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/580e6ed6fd2e615259000040.js?muted=1\"></div></div><p>But while Clinton traverses the country insisting that she was unfairly outflanked by unserious ideas, Sanders seems to be winning that same war of ideas in Congress. In the past week, more than a dozen Democratic senators have signed on as co-sponsors of a Sanders-backed single-payer health-care bill, to be unveiled on Wednesday. Among the list flirting with the âMedicare for allâ proposal are a number of lawmakers whose names have surfaced as potential 2020 contenders, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/democrats-warm-to-sanders-single-payer-plan-in-health-care-shift\">including</a> <strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong> of Massachusetts, <strong>Cory Booker</strong> of New Jersey, <strong>Kamala Harris</strong> of California, <strong>Al Franken</strong> of Minnesota, and <strong>Kirsten Gillibrand</strong> of New York. Itâs hardly Sandersâs promised âpolitical revolution,â at least not yet, but the partyâs goal posts are suddenly shifting dramatically in his direction.</p>\n<p>Clinton, who famously described herself during the campaign as âa progressive that likes to get things done,â rightly <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/13/16297454/hillary-clinton-single-payer-vox-interview\">pointed out</a> Tuesday that there are few details included in the latest Sanders plan. For starters, it remains unclear what âsingle-payerâ means and how it would be paid for. But while Clinton remains worried that pushing for a single-payer system will distract from more achievable, incremental steps like a public option or expanding Medicare, Democrats in Congress are choosing not to get hung up on policy. Several senators have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/9/13/16297454/hillary-clinton-single-payer-vox-interview\">signed on to multiple competing visions</a> for universal health care, choosing to win the political argument before hammering out the policy details. â[Sandersâs] bill is aspirational, and Iâm hopeful that it can serve as a starting point for where we need to go as a country,â Franken <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/13/bernie-sanders-single-payer-democrats-medicare-242616\">said</a> in a statement.</p>\n<p>The sheer number of lawmakers that have signaled they are open to discussing a single-payer system suggests that it will continue to be a key issue as the race for 2020 heats up. Itâs certainly a vindicating moment for Sanders, who didnât manage to attract any co-sponsors for a similar bill back in 2013. And while neither House Minority Leader <strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong> nor Senate Minority Leader <strong>Chuck Schumer</strong> have backed the bill, there are signs it could soon become a litmus test for Democratic candidates. On Tuesday, <strong>Tammy Baldwin</strong> of Wisconsin <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/13/bernie-sanders-single-payer-democrats-medicare-242616\">became</a> the first Democratic senator up for re-election in a state Trump carried to sign on to the proposal. Even <strong>Joe Manchin</strong> of West Virginia, which went for Trump by more than 40 points in 2016, said he is open to the idea of a single-payer system, though he expressed skepticism.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["hillary clinton","bernie sanders","single-payer","democratic","medicare","health-care

Clintonâs Book Tour","body":"<p>On Tuesday, <strong>Hillary Clintonâs</strong> memoir slash election postmortem, <em>What Happened,</em> will be released, followed by a cross-country airing of grievances-cum-national book tour that will run through December. Perhaps unsurprisingly, members of her own party and even people who worked to get her elected are less than enthused about the 15-city tour, which kicks off in D.C. on September 18. âOh, God,â âI canât handle it,â and âthe final tortureâ were among the responses from former campaign aides <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/07/hillary-clinton-book-tour-democrats-242419\">polled by Politico</a>. âI think she should just zip it, but sheâs not going to,â one major Democratic donor said.</p>\n<p>Clinton fatigue has been building as Democrats look to move on from relitigating the 2016 election, bury the hatchet with <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> supporters, and prepare for the 2018 midterms. But Clinton isnât ready to let go just yet, preparing one last major public therapy session before shifting gears into whatever phase of her post-campaign political life comes next. Her new memoir is partly an apologia as she seeks to make that transition, with Clinton writing in already-released excerpts that she takes full responsibility for her loss to <strong>Donald Trump.</strong> But <em>What Happened</em> is also a burn book filled with finger-pointing at a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/people-clinton-blames-for-her-election-loss\">long list of people</a> on Clintonâs blacklist, including Sanders, <strong>Joe Biden,</strong> and even <strong>Barack Obama.</strong></p>\n<p>Democratic strategists worry it will inflame tensions within the Democratic Party just when it most desperately needs to be coming together. The book and tour are coming âmaybe at the worst possible time, as we are fighting some of the most high-stakes policy and institutional battles we may ever see, at a time when weâre trying to bring the party together so we can all move the party forward&#8212;stronger, <em>stronger together,</em>â Rep. <strong>Jared Huffman,</strong> told Politico. âSheâs got every right to tell her story. Who am I to say she shouldnât, or how she should tell it? But it is difficult for some of us, even like myself whoâve supported her, to play out all these media cycles about the blame game, and the excuses.â</p>\n<p>The greater fear is that not only will the tour trigger election P.T.S.D. and divide Democrats, but that it will give a fractious and fractured Republican Party an easy target to unite against, bringing the G.O.P.âs warring wings together in their shared hatred of Clinton.</p>\n<p>Of course, not <em>everyone</em> wishes HRC would stay home. âHer book and her tour is not just important for history, itâs so important for now,â Democratic National Committee fund-raiser <strong>Robert Zimmerman</strong> told Politico. âItâs a very healthy conversation to have, and itâs important to put the internal party issues in perspective. If weâre going to move forward as a party, and if weâre going to move forward as a country, Hillary Clintonâs experiences, her insight, is essential.â</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["hillary clinton"],"ledeCaption":"An notion that apparently fills some people with dread.","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"âI think she should just zip it, but sheâs not going to.â","seoTitle":"âThe Final Tortureâ: Democrats Bemoan Clintonâs Book Tour","seoDescription":"âI think she should just zip it, but sheâs not going to.â","socialTitle":"âThe Final Tortureâ: Democrats Bemoan Clintonâs Book Tour","socialDescription":"âI think she should just zip it, but sheâs not going to.â","issueDate":"","rubric":"HRC","promoHed":"âThe Final Tortureâ: Democrats Bemoan Clintonâs Book Tour","promoDek":"âI think she should just zip it, but sheâs not going to.â","id":"59b14fdf611ef1173dcad69c","revision":2,"createdAt":"September 7, 2017 9:55 am","modifiedAt":"September 7, 2017 10:00 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 7, 2017 10:00 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Kenzie Bryant","filename":"hillary-clinton-makeup-looks.jpg","title":"hillary-clinton-makeup-looks.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":960,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2016/11/17/582e2f77364154776b0baba5_hillary-clinton-makeup-looks.jpg"}},"credit":"Copyright (c) 2016 Rex Features.

Itâs truly the best decision I ever made to be persistent enough\nto ask you out on a date that you finally gave in, and I hope you feel\nthe same way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed block video row\"><div class=\"wrapper\"><iframe height=\"315\" width=\"560\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a161Dv1dlJ4\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allowtransparency=\"true\"> </iframe></div></div><p>It could have been an moment for eye-rolls (Michelle did get a few sheepish ones in at the appropriate times).

Really, truly strong? Who among us can look ahead with unwavering steely purpose as one moment after another approaches and recedes into view, like a series of imposing evergreens along a highway? Who has not once slumped over the wheel&#8212;sure, the metaphorical one&#8212;and let out a great sob as yet another life-defining event has come and gone? Timeâs creep is incessant. Surely youâve heard that by now. A tear or two is just one of our defenses.</p>\n<p>Why are we talking about natureâs coping mechanism, the old sodium drip at the ducts?  Because former president <strong>Barack Obama</strong> cried after he dropped his daughter <strong>Malia</strong> off at Harvard for her first year of college at the end of August. His essential humanity is our essential humanity, now more than ever.</p>\n<p>âFor those of us who have daughters, it just happens fast,â he said. Obama was speaking at the Beau Biden Foundationâs golf and tennis invitational at Delawareâs Wilmington Country Club. The local radio station, WDEL, posted a <a href=\"http://www.wdel.com/news/former-pres-obama-in-delaware-to-honor-beau-biden/article_8888c3b2-a260-11e7-addf-93be2c21f6cd.html\">video</a> of the former presidentâs Sunday appearance in support of the foundation, which former vice president <strong>Joe Biden</strong> and his wife <strong>Jill</strong> started, and named after their son, who died of brain cancer in 2015.</p>\n<p>Dropping off his eldest with all her toiletries and bedding, going out tops and books was âa little bit like open-heart surgery,â he said. âI was proud that I did not cry in front of her. But on the way back, the Secret Service was off, looking straight ahead, pretending they werenât hearing me as I sniffled and blew my nose. It was rough.â</p>\n<p>No word though on how Malia feels hearing about it now, like this. What would the 19-year-old have done, knowing that dad was having a moment? Would she have offered a genial pat on the shoulder, and said, âI know this is hard. Itâs hard for me, too. But itâs also exciting. Think of all the great things Iâm about to do?â Seems like something the daughter of Barack and Michelle would say.</p>\n<p>Maybe itâs better that his ever-trusty Secret Service detail was the only witness to Obamaâs emotional moment, which has now passed him by, just like these sorts of moments will pass all of us by. May we all be so lucky to mark their transience with a little dignity while stone-faced suits look away.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["president obama","secret service","joe biden","malia obama","vanities"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Why is dad crying?","seoTitle":"Barack Obama Admits He Shed a Tear or Two After Dropping Malia Off at College","seoDescription":"Why is dad crying?","socialTitle":"Barack Obama Admits He Shed a Tear or Two After Dropping Malia Off at College","socialDescription":"Why is dad crying?","issueDate":"","rubric":"Having a Moment","promoHed":"Barack Obama Admits He Shed a Tear or Two After Dropping Malia Off at College","promoDek":"Why is dad crying?","id":"59cb94f06a848b44d4891334","revision":21,"createdAt":"September 27, 2017 8:09 am","modifiedAt":"September 28, 2017 10:11 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 28, 2017 10:11 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Kenzie Bryant","filename":"barack-obama-tears.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1440,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":1440,"height":864,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":640,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":640,"x":400,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":540,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":540,"x":450,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1435,"height":615,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1440,"height":810,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":1280,"height":960,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1280,"x":80,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":901,"height":901,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":267,"y":43,"height":901,"width":901}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/27/59cbab2f0ed3e4104cde704e_barack-obama-tears.jpg","width":1440,"height":961,"duration":null}},"title":"President Obama Delivers Farewell Address In Chicago","description":"631551592","caption":"President Barack Obama wipes away tears during his farewell address.

During her time in the White House, she proved that she knew how to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJ45VLgbe_E\">charm an entire crowd with a catchphrase</a>, inspire sedentary Americans to eat vegetables, and <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2017/07/week-in-fashion-michelle-obama-espys\">rock any sleeveless dress</a> with ease. But now, months after leaving 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., she has proven yet another skill&#8212;her A-plus Instagram talents. On every birthday and vacation, the former First Lady sends out the perfectly curated Instagram post. Tuesday was no exception, as Obama posted a black-and-white wedding photo for her 25th wedding anniversary with <strong>Barack.</strong></p>\n<p>âA quarter of a century later, youâre still my best friend &amp; the most extraordinary man I know,â she wrote.</p>\n<p>The shot, which features the young couple fresh-faced and smiling in 1992, is just one of several treasured family photos she has decorating her Instagram page.

This means a couple of important things: 1) No, youâre not dreaming, <strong>Donald Trump</strong> really is the leader of the free world and 2) Obama is more likely to become the next owner of the Miss Universe pageant than he is to ever hold public office again. In his post-presidential life, as past presidents often do, Obama has become a regular fixture on the speaking circuit. <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/04/obama-cashes-in-bank-speaking-fee\">Back in April</a>, it was announced that he would be delivering the keynote address at Cantor Fitzgeraldâs health-care conference in September, for which he was expected to be paid $400,000; last month, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-18/obama-goes-from-white-house-to-wall-street-in-less-than-one-year\">according to Bloomberg</a>, he received approximately the same amount for giving a speech to clients of Northern Trust Corp; and last week, he âreminisced about the White Houseâ for private-equity giant Carlyle Group. And although the chance of him running for office again are, again, approximately zero, people are still worried about all that <em>corrupting influence</em> he might be susceptible to. âHeâs continuing to exercise the authority,â <strong>Jeff Hauser,</strong> the head of the Revolving Door Project told Bloomberg. âHe ought to forgo a few hundred thousand here and maybe a half-million there.â</p>\n<p>Yes, itâs possible Obama isnât setting the best example for future Democratic lawmakers. Just ask <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> who <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/hillary-clinton-what-happened-goldman-sachs\">said</a> in her election postmortem, <em>What Happened,</em> that she regrets the paid talks she gave at Wall Street banks after she stepped down as secretary of state. Of course, there are several differences. While leaked transcripts of Clintonâs speeches revealed that she had not, as Trump and <strong>Bernie Sanders</strong> insinuated, hatched a plan with investment bankers to screw the little guy, she would <em>go on</em> to run for office, whereas Obama, having been president, doesnât really have any growth opportunities in that area. Itâs not like Obama was a Warren-esque white knight beforehand, anyway: while many bankers are still steaming about him calling them âfat catsâ in 2009, those who were upset by his rhetoric were presumably soothed by the fact that no bankers were prosecuted for their part in causing the financial crisis under his watch and, as Bloombergâs <strong>Max Abelson</strong> points out, âhe resisted calls to break up the biggest banks, signing a regulatory overhaul that annoyed them with new rules but didnât stop them from pulling in record profits.â He may as well take the victory lap.</p>\n<p>Obama is too magnanimous to punish bankers by denying them his wisdom, anyway. âHe was the president of the entire United States&#8212;financial services are under that umbrella,â former UBS executive and longtime supporter <strong>Robert Wolf</strong> told Bloomberg. âHe doesnât look at Wall Street like, âOh, these are individuals who donât want the best for the country.â He doesnât stereotype.â</p>\n<p><em><strong>If you would like to receive the Levin Report in your inbox daily, <a href=\"http://tinyletter.com/besslevin\">click here</a> to subscribe.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong>Equifax trio who dumped shares are being criminally probed</strong></p>\n<p>In a turn of events that you didnât need a doctorate in securities fraud to predict, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-18/equifax-stock-sales-said-to-be-focus-of-u-s-criminal-probe\">reports</a> that the Department of Justice has opened a criminal investigation into the stock sales of three Equifax executives, and whether or not they constituted insider trading. To recap, three days after the company says it learned that as many as 143 million Americans may have had their personal information stolen in a massive data breach, but weeks before the public was informed, Chief Financial Officer <strong>John Gamble,</strong> President of Workforce Solutions <strong>Rodolfo Ploder,</strong> and President of U.S. Information Solutions <strong>Joseph Loughran</strong> sold nearly $2 million worth of Equifax shares. According to a company spokesperson, the trio which, as a reminder, was comprised of senior executives and the <em>chief financial officer of the organization,</em> were not aware of the hack at the time they placed the trades. If thatâs true, itâs great for Gamble, Ploder, and Loughran&#8212;itâs always good when you can prove you werenât trading on material non-public information!&#8212;but less great for the company, considering an absolutely enormous attack on nearly half the U.S. populationâs data seems like it would rank as the sort of information senior management should be informed of three days after it was discovered. But who are we to tell Equifax how to run its business?</p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of insider trading . . .</strong></p>\n<p>A former SAC Capital trader who pleaded guilty of it has <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-sac-insidertrading-lee/ex-sac-trader-says-he-forgot-facts-seeks-to-void-insider-trading-plea-idUSKCN1BT2DB\">just remembered something</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[<strong>Richard Lee</strong>] wants to withdraw his 2013 insider trading guilty plea, saying he had forgotten about two instant messages that show he committed no crime. Lee said in Monday court filings that the messages uncovered in the last few months demonstrated how his purchase of 725,000 Yahoo Inc shares on July 10, 2009 was based on public information. The plea was part of a cooperation agreement with prosecutors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Trump views U.N. meeting as opportunity to shill for Trump Tower</strong></p>\n<p>Trump, who handed over day-to-day management of the Trump Organization to sons who say they provide him with <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/eric-trump-sharing-business-updates-father-236464\">quarterly financial updates</a>, and who worked Mar-a-Lagoâs beautiful chocolate cake into a conversation about bombing Syria, saw a business opportunity at the U.N. today. Per <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/18/trump-united-nations-2017-opening-242836\">Politico</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Trump thanked <strong>Nikki Haley</strong> for the introduction and paused for a brief applause. âI actually saw great potential right across the street, to be honest with you,â the president said, referring to Trump World Tower. âAnd it was only for the reason that the United Nations was here that that turned out to be such a successful project.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Anthony Scaramucciâs SkyBridge sale âon trackâ</strong></p>\n<p>In

First, the Grammy-winning singer released her long-awaited cosmetics line, Fenty Beauty, on September 8 and was met with massive praise from both beauty critics and fans. Two days later, she debuted her spring 2018 Fenty x Puma runway collection with a <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/rihanna-fenty-puma-show-motocross-bike-nyfw\">crowd-pleasing, high-octane, motocross-themed show</a> held at the Park Avenue Armory. And finally, at her third annual Diamond Ball on Thursday night, she shined bright like a diamond and helped raise nearly $1 million (and counting) for the Clara Lionel Foundation, a nonprofit named in honor of her grandparents, Clara and <strong>Lionel Braithwaite.</strong> The ultra-glamorous black-tie affair drew <strong>BeyoncÃ©, Jay-Z, Leonardo DiCaprio, Trevor Noah, Jamie Foxx,</strong> and more of the New York City A-list who werenât too worn out by Fashion Week for one last party.</p>\n<p>For Rihanna, creating the Clara Lionel Foundation five years ago has been one of her greatest accomplishments, and she says that through her grandparents, she has learned to become selfless.</p>\n<p>âTheyâve been my biggest role models in my life. They gave me a new perspective and taught me not to be selfish and to give back to people,â Rihanna said inside the lavish ball held at New Yorkâs Cipriani Wall Street. âMy grandmother instilled in me a kind spirit to always help people. Sheâs very giving. My grandfather taught me to have a strong work ethic and that everyone can make a difference by helping each other. Creating this foundation is the most important thing Iâve done with my life. I love music, I love fashion, I love makeup, I love everything that I have done, but giving back is the most important and I want to help and make a difference in peopleâs lives.â</p>\n<p>Dressed in a show-stopping black Ralph &amp; Russo gown and wearing Chopard diamond jewelry, Rihanna attended the glitzy party with Lionel, her mother, <strong>Monica Braithwaite,</strong> and her extended family. (Clara died of cancer in 2012.) Comedian <strong>Dave Chappelle</strong> played the eveningâs host and kicked off the soirÃ©e with some harsh zingers about <strong>Donald Trump.</strong> âThe president is fucking up . . . the guy is falling apart at the seams. All his ideas sound like high-people ideas,â he said from the stage. âHeâs playing all the wrong games. Itâs not checkers or chess, this is Jenga, and that motherfucker is pulling all the middle blocks.â</p>\n<p>During the eventâs live auction, President <strong>Barack Obama</strong> delivered a taped message thanking Rihanna for her humanitarian work and offered guests the chance to meet him at the Obama Foundationâs Fall Summit in Chicago on November 1, where leaders from around the world will gather to share ideas. The winning bid came in at $275,000.</p>\n<p>After the auction, Rihanna shouted out to the well-dressed crowd to gather near the stage to watch performer <strong>Kendrick Lamar</strong> rap some of his hit songs. Immediately after, <strong>Calvin Harris</strong> took the stage, which got BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z to hit the dance floor. Making their first red-carpet appearance since the birth of their twins, <strong>Rumi and Sir Carter,</strong> the couple were all smiles and shimmied together near the right side of stage past midnight. BeyoncÃ© even did a few twirls while Jay-Z clapped for his wife. At one point, Harris played Jay-Zâs âShow Me What You Gotâ and BeyoncÃ© sang along.</p>\n<p>Harris, who has collaborated with Rihanna on a few songs, most notably on the 2011 hit song âWe Found Love,â said he is proud to call Rihanna a friend.</p>\n<p>âThereâs a lot that I admire about her. Itâs a combination between her longevity and how diverse she is in her career and how sheâs committed to helping other people,â Harris said ahead of his performance on Thursday. âSheâs really helping to make the world a better place in the best way that she can using her resources for such good, and thatâs inspiring.â</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Parties","tags":[],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"It

About Facebook","body":"<p>In the days immediately after the 2016 election, Facebook C.E.O. <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong> seemed offended by suggestions that the social network he created might have had any influence on the outcome, beyond serving as a marketplace for the exchange of ideas. âPersonally, I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, itâs a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,â <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-donald-trump-2016-11\">he said</a>, on stage at the Techonomy conference in Half Moon Bay, California. While some were quick to blame Facebook for amplifying misinformation about <strong>Hillary Clinton,</strong> Zuckerberg suggested that critics were betraying a âprofound lack of empathyâ by not taking voters who supported <strong>Donald Trump</strong> seriously.</p>\n<p>Zuckerberg wasnât wrong to be skeptical of Democrats assigning blame rather than engaging in self-reflection. But in dismissing the possibility that social media might be anything other than a force for good, Zuckerberg was also slow to recognize Facebookâs own vulnerabilities in an age of information warfare. About a week after the Techonomy conference, however, Zuckerberg received a âwake-up callâ from President <strong>Barack Obama,</strong> <em>The Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-tried-to-give-zuckerberg-a-wake-up-call-over-fake-news-on-facebook/2017/09/24/15d19b12-ddac-4ad5-ac6e-ef909e1c1284_story.html?utm_term=.f70f7bbd387f\">reports</a>. During a meeting of world leaders in Lima, Peru, nine days after the election, Obama tried to personally appeal to Zuckerberg, warning that unless Facebook did something, its fake-news problem would only be exacerbated in the next presidential election:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For months leading up to the vote, Obama and his top aides quietly agonized over how to respond to Russiaâs brazen intervention on behalf of the Donald Trump campaign without making matters worse. Weeks after Trumpâs surprise victory, some of Obamaâs aides looked back with regret and wished they had done more.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem posed by fake news. But he told Obama that those messages werenât widespread on Facebook and that there was no easy remedy, according to people briefed on the exchange, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share details of a private conversation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The account of Zuckerbergâs post-election reckoning also reveals new details about what Facebook executives knew, and when they knew it. The <em>Post</em> reports that Facebook notified the F.B.I. as early as June 2016 when a hacking group working in connection to the GRU, the Russian military intelligence unit, started making fake Facebook profiles to disseminate stolen e-mails and manipulate public opinion&#8212;days before Guccifer 2.0, a hacking persona now thought to be a front for Russian intelligence, took credit for hacking the Democratic National Committee. But after looking into the accounts, which were linked to the GRUâs hacking group called APT28 or Fancy Bear, which set up a Facebook profile for Guccifer 2.0 and a Facebook page called DCLeaks, the company came to believe they werenât linked to a foreign government but were instead financially motivated.</p>\n<p>It took months for Facebook to publicly acknowledge what was clear to the Obama administration much earlier. Now, nearly a year after the election, Zuckerberg has <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/09/mark-zuckerberg-backtracks-as-his-russia-problem-spirals\">backtracked</a> on his initial dismissals about fake news. Last week, amid bipartisan congressional furor over what some lawmakers said was Facebookâs unwillingness to share information about Russian interference, Zuckerberg announced online that Facebook would be handing congressional investigators more than 3,000 ads it believes were purchased by a Russian troll farm from 2015 to 2017; he conceded that Facebook had been manipulated during the election; and outlined nine steps he says Facebook will be taking to ensure election interference canât happen on its platform in the future.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Tech","tags":["facebook","mark zuckerberg","russian","barack obama","election interference","2016 election"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016&#8212;but didnât recognize the magnitude of the threat.","seoTitle":"Zuckerberg Brushed Off Obamaâs Private Warnings About Facebook","seoDescription":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016âbut didnât recognize the magnitude of the threat.","socialTitle":"Zuckerberg Brushed Off Obamaâs Private Warnings About Facebook","socialDescription":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016âbut didnât recognize the magnitude of the threat.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Facebook","promoHed":"Zuckerberg Brushed Off Obamaâs Private Warnings About Facebook","promoDek":"Facebook found evidence of Russian interference as early as June 2016&#8212;but didnât recognize the magnitude of the threat.","id":"59c8f9503d8edb5fbd6dbf6b","revision":2,"createdAt":"September 25, 2017 8:40 am","modifiedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:18 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:18 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Maya Kosoff","filename":"GettyImages-142385209.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1440,"height":989,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/25/59c90196a7823e560061b760_GettyImages-142385209.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":960,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":960,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":987,"width":658,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":987,"width":658,"x":391,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":976,"width":549,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":976,"width":549,"x":445.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":615,"width":1435,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":615,"width":1435,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":810,"width":1440,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":810,"width":1440,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":987,"width":1316,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":987,"width":1316,"x":62,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":989,"width":989,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":989,"width":989,"x":225.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"US President Barack Obama speaks as Face","description":"250: 142385209","caption":"","credit":"By Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59c90196a7823e560061b761","revision":1,"createdAt":"September 25, 2017 9:16 am","modifiedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:16 am","revisionCreatedAt":"September 25, 2017 9:16 am","tags":[],"altText":"US President Barack Obama speaks as Face","modelName":"photo"}}],"contributorsAuthor":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Zac Frank","name":"Maya Kosoff","bio":"Maya Kosoff writes about tech for VF.com, with a focus on start-ups and venture capital.

Itâs about who we are as a people&#8212;and who we want to be.â</p>\n<p>Hours earlier, Attorney General <strong>Jeff Sessions</strong> announced that the administration would be rescinding Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, better known as DACA, a policy Obama instituted in 2012 to allow undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children to apply for renewable permits protecting them from deportation and allowing them to work in the country legally. Nearly 800,000 people applied for DACA status, entrusting the federal government with information identifying them as undocumented. On Tuesday, the Trump administration violated that trust, insisting that while DACA recipients wouldnât be prioritized for deportation, they would be treated the same as any other illegal immigrant.</p>\n<p>âImmigration can be a controversial topic,â Obama conceded, explaining that he was forced to take action after Congress repeatedly failed to write legislation addressing the millions of people in the country illegally. âBecause it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country.â</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âBut today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again. To target these young people is wrong &#8211; because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating &#8211; because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The nearly 900-word <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10155227588436749\">statement</a>, posted on Facebook, was an unusually public rebuke from the former president, who has largely avoided his successor. Obama has rarely interjected himself in national politics since leaving office, only explicitly criticizing <strong>Donald Trump</strong> when he signed an executive order banning travel from several majority-Muslim countries, in January, and again in June, when Senate Republicans released a draft version of their Obamacare replacement. In both instances, the former president conspicuously avoided mentioning Trump by name, a pattern he continued in his denunciation of the president on Tuesday.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Letâs be clear: the action taken today isnât required legally. Itâs a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldnât threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us. They are that pitcher on our kidâs softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out wonât lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyoneâs taxes, or raise anybodyâs wages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The majority of Trump voters agree. According to a Morning Consult <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2017/06/16/poll-trumps-decision-dreamers-popular-one-even-among-base/\">poll</a> from April, 73 percent of registered Republicans believe immigrants protected by DACA should be allowed to remain in the United States; 48 percent said they should have a path to becoming U.S. citizens.</p>\n<p>Obama had faced criticism for using his executive authority to circumvent Congress&#8212;a decision he defended again on Tuesday as âbased on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretionâ&#8212;but expressed the hope that lawmakers, this time, would finally hammer out a compromise. âIâm heartened by those whoâve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel.â</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âWhat makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray. What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals &#8211; that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation. Thatâs how America has traveled this far. Thatâs how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"embed cneembed\"><div class=\"embed block cneembed\" data-url=\"//player.cnevids.com/script/video/58828806fd2e613241000017.js?muted=1\"></div></div>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["barack obama","daca","congress","Donald Trump"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Polling shows the majority of Trump voters agree.","seoTitle":"Obama Calls Trump Move âCruelâ in Emotional Defense of DACA","seoDescription":"Polling shows the majority of Trump voters agree.","socialTitle":"Obama Calls Trump Move âCruelâ in Emotional Defense of DACA","socialDescription":"Polling shows the majority of Trump voters agree.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Immigration Reform","promoHed":"Obama Calls Trump Move âCruelâ in Emotional Defense of DACA","promoDek":"Polling shows the majority of Trump voters agree.","id":"59af11c9924989694624c33a","revision":2,"createdAt":"September 5, 2017 5:06 pm","modifiedAt":"September 5, 2017 5:09 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 5, 2017 5:09 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Tina Nguyen","filename":"Obama-DACA-Response.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/09/05/59af11a4e7efff694647f9ef_Obama-DACA-Response.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":429,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":484,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"95974124","credit":"By Steffi Loos/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59af11a4924989694624c32d","revision":2,"createdAt":"September 5, 2017 5:05 pm","modifiedAt":"September 5, 2017 5:06 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"September 5, 2017 5:06 pm","tags":[],"altText":" Obama during a meeting with Angela Merkel in Berlin on May 25th.","description":"Getty;

It makes sense that 44 might be setting his sights on this part of town; the building has been home to plenty of bold-face names, including <strong>Gloria Vanderbilt,</strong> and <em>New Yorker</em> critic Alexander Woollcott, and <a href=\"http://www.fredrikeklund.com/listing/cms/10-gracie-square-6a/\">even the former First Lady of China</a>. It also has 15 floors and 43 apartments, meaning <em>several</em> lucky New Yorkers could have some presidential neighbors sometime soon.</p>\n<p>The duplex went into contract last week for $10 million and was designed by architect <strong>Daniel Romualdez.</strong> The space boasts five bedrooms, four baths, a library with a wood-burning fireplace, and views of the East River. Though this Manhattan pad might go for a big price, itâs one that the Obamas, who moved into their $8.1 million Washington, D.C., home earlier this year, can surely swing.</p>\n<p>Since they moved out of the White House in January, the couple has been a hot commodity. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/01/barack-obama-speaking-fees-economic-racial-justice\"><em>The Guardian</em> noted</a> in May, the presidentâs speaking fees are a pretty $400,000. To add to that, in March the Obamas <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/barack-michelle-obama-land-book-deal\">landed a joint book deal</a> with a reported $65 million advance.</p>\n<p>The former Chicago residents might be new to New York, but they have spent quite a lot of time in the city since January. Late this winter <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/barack-michelle-obama-lunch-with-bono\">they joined</a> <strong>Bono</strong> for lunch in Manhattan, which as all New Yorkers know, is a completely normal afternoon activity. What other power lunches might they indulge in while living just blocks from Le Cirque? If it does happen, be certain that every New York tabloid will be all over it.</p>\n<p><em>Vanity Fair</em> has reached out to a representative for the Obamas for comment.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Celebrity","tags":["new york city","obamas","upper east side","manhattan","barack and michelle obama"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"New POTUS in town.","seoTitle":"What Happens If the Obamas Move to the Upper East Side?","seoDescription":"New POTUS in town.","socialTitle":"What Happens If the Obamas Move to the Upper East Side?","socialDescription":"New POTUS in town.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Real Estate","promoHed":"What Happens If the Obamas Move to the Upper East Side?","promoDek":"New POTUS in town.","id":"59d29bbe09c9fb75e7139b91","revision":9,"createdAt":"October 2, 2017 4:04 pm","modifiedAt":"October 2, 2017 4:26 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 2, 2017 4:26 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Hilary Weaver","filename":"Obamas-UES-Move.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1512,"height":1008,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/10/02/59d29cd68ec2206eb700442e_Obamas-UES-Move.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1008,"width":1512,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1008,"width":1512,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":906,"width":1510,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":906,"width":1510,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1008,"width":672,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1008,"width":672,"x":420,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1008,"width":567,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1008,"width":567,"x":472.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":648,"width":1512,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":648,"width":1512,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":846,"width":1504,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":846,"width":1504,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1008,"width":1344,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1008,"width":1344,"x":84,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1008,"width":1008,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1008,"width":1008,"x":252,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"AFP_D42PL","credit":"By Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"59d29cd68ec2206eb700442f","revision":1,"createdAt":"October 2, 2017 4:08 pm","modifiedAt":"October 2, 2017 4:10 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"October 2, 2017 4:10 pm","tags":[],"altText":"AFP_D42PL","description":"Getty;

The usually designer-clad Trump flew from Camp David to D.C. over the weekend wearing a surprisingly affordable $75 pink gingham shirt from J.Crew along with a pair of matching J Brand pink pants and Manolo Blahnik flats. According to <a href=\"https://ca.style.yahoo.com/melania-trump-revives-j-crew-first-lady-uniform-213934631.html\">Yahoo Style Canada</a>, the button-up top is a discontinued piece from the brandâs 2012 collection. Perhaps sheâs been waiting to save the economical top for just the right moment in her First Lady reign.</p>\n<p>The mall brand is a major departure from the First Ladyâs typical designer wardrobe, which is occasionally criticized for being <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/05/26/about-melania-trump-and-that-51500-jacket-she-wore-in-italy/?utm_term=.009248680306\">over the top</a> and out of touch. Trumpâs predecessor Michelle Obama was often lauded for <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2009/01/the-obamas-and-jcrew-a-match-made-in-publicity-heaven\">wearing J.Crew</a> during her time in the White House, coming across as a more relatable and accessible First Lady than many in the past. It seems entirely possible that Trump is ripping out a page from the Obama handbook in order to drum up some much-needed goodwill from the public.</p>\n<p>But this isnât the first time someone in the Trump family has made news for stepping out in J.Crew. Eleven-year-old <strong>Barron Trump</strong> <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/barron-trumps-jcrew-expert-tee-draws-attention-twitter-1012529\">made headlines</a> shortly after he moved into the White House after he was photographed wearing a blue graphic tee that read âThe Expert.â Last week he wore <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/article/lifestyle/2017/08/22/barron-trump-j-crew-shirt-chelsea-clinton/23157298/\">another J.Crew shirt</a> that said âOn your mark tiger shark,â which has since sold out.</p>\n<p>Melania Trump later headed out to Houston on Tuesday morning to visit the areaâs flooding from Hurricane Harvey wearing her usual stilettos and skinny trousers. If she has another J.Crew shirt somewhere in the back of her closet (and maybe an extra pair of flats), letâs hope she packed it.</p>","channel":"Style","subChannel":"Fashion","tags":["melania trump","j crew","michelle obama","vanities"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"Over the weekend Trump traded in her designer clothes for something much more affordable.","seoTitle":"Melania Trump Takes a Fashion Cue from Michelle Obama","seoDescription":"Over the weekend Trump traded in her designer clothes for something much more affordable.","socialTitle":"Melania Trump Takes a Fashion Cue from Michelle Obama","socialDescription":"Over the weekend Trump traded in her designer clothes for something much more affordable.","issueDate":"","rubric":"Melania","promoHed":"Melania Trump Takes a Fashion Cue from Michelle Obama","promoDek":"Over the weekend Trump traded in her designer clothes for something much more affordable.","id":"59a581c7bcd19403633dbf1f","revision":11,"createdAt":"August 29, 2017 11:01 am","modifiedAt":"August 29, 2017 11:56 am","revisionCreatedAt":"August 29, 2017 11:56 am","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Erika Harwood","filename":"t-Melania-Trump-J-Crew.jpg","aspectRatios":{"3:2":{"width":1104,"height":736,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":736,"width":1104,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"width":1100,"height":660,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1100,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"width":490,"height":735,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":735,"width":490,"x":307,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"width":264,"height":470,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"x":562,"y":35,"height":470,"width":264}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"width":1099,"height":471,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":471,"width":1099,"x":2.5,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"width":1104,"height":621,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":621,"width":1104,"x":0,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"width":980,"height":735,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":735,"width":980,"x":62,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"width":736,"height":736,"override":false,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":736,"width":736,"x":184,"y":0}},"duration":null},"master":{"format":"JPEG","url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/08/29/59a58342bcd19403633dbf20_t-Melania-Trump-J-Crew.jpg","width":1104,"height":736,"duration":null}},"title":"9028308p","credit":"By Greg E.

The violence also brought an elegantly concise tweet from former President <strong>Barack Obama</strong>  quoting Nelson Mandela, which he posted on Saturday. By Wednesday morning, Obama&#39;s tweet had received the highest number of likes ever, according to Twitter:</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/896523232098078720\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/896523232098078720\">https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/896523232098078720</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Nostalgia for Obama among his supporters has only grown since the day he left office; every post on social media, or <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/michelle-obama-is-still-here-to-reassure-america\">public appearance by <strong>Michelle Obama</strong></a>, has been typically met with cries of âCome back!â But Obamaâs viral tweet, in all its calming guidance, followed by two more that completed the Mandela passage, arrived at a time when Trump appeared at his least presidential. It is the easiest thing in the world, as multiple late-night comedians have pointed out, to condemn Nazis; Trump, in three separate speeches, couldn&#39;t manage to pull it off.  But Obama showed exactly how easy it could be.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#39;t just an 140-character lesson in how to act presidential; it was also Obama besting Trump at his favorite medium, Twitter. Obama, with the most-liked tweet of all time, has beaten Trump here, a fact the numbers-obsessed president is not likely to miss. Though neither of the Obamas have <a href=\"http://people.com/politics/what-does-barack-obama-really-think-of-donald-trump-hes-nothing-but-a-bullsh-ter/?crl8_id=a19fd0e0-add4-461c-90ed-693d8cd746c8\">actively spoken out against</a> any of Trumpâs actions, their occasional public appearances&#8212;from Michelle <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/06/michelle-obama-steve-bannon-fitness-fat-shame\">continuing to promote fitness</a> to Barack&#39;s occasional but pointed tweets&#8212;act as a counter-force to the ongoing D.C. turmoil.</p>\n<p>We&#39;ll see how much longer the former president can keep things this subtle. With former Presidents <strong>George H.W. Bush</strong> and <strong>George W. Bush</strong> <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2017/08/16/politics/republicans-list-denouncing-trump-by-name/index.html\">releasing a joint statement</a> Wednesday condemning white supremacy, it&#39;s possible Obama will feel compelled to take a more active role in opposing the Trump administration.</p>\n<p>But in the meantime, thereâs this powerful tweet, which like <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2012/11/07/obama-most-liked-facebook/\">so many posts</a> of the Obama presidency comes with a stirring photo (of Obama casually greeting young children at a window) that says at least as much as his words. (Trump has photos, too, but they convey <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/photos/2017/04/donald-and-melania-trump-marriage#9\">something vastly different</a>.) Obamaâs record-breaking tweet is still the first thing visitors see on his Twiter page. Trumpâs Twitter, on the other hand, features a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JackPosobiec/status/897107711434915842\">retweet about violence in Chicago</a>, another tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/897293484884979712\">that celebrates</a> âbeing homeâ in New York, along with a seemingly random âMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAINâ <a

Office Makeover, Blames Obama for Wallpaper Stains","body":"<p>When <strong>Donald Trump</strong> returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue after his âworking vacationâ in Bedminster, the West Wing had undergone some radical changes. For one, <strong>Steve Bannon</strong> had been fired. But just as prominently, the White House had finally received a much-needed $3.4 million upgrade. While Trump deservedly caught some flack for allegedly <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/08/05/white-house-to-become-less-dump-like-in-trumps-absence/?utm_term=.a0484c36ad8d\">calling the residence</a> a âdump,â current and former administration staffers have <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/03/life-in-trump-west-wing-241294\">admitted</a> the property could use some sprucing up. The renovation, approved during the Obama administration, included updating a 27-year-old H.V.A.C. system, upgrading I.T. systems, and repairing the South Portico steps for the first time since the Eisenhower administration. Much like any fixer-upper project, though, the structural changes gave the new administration a chance to change the decor&#8212;an opportunity that Trump, an amateur interior decorator with an eye for Louis XIV-style glitz, apparently seized with vigor.</p>\n<p>CBS News <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/west-wing-gets-new-look-in-trump-white-house-renovations/\">toured</a> the new digs, which include a refresh of the Navy mess, the West Wingâs V.I.P. lobby, and the Roosevelt Room, which is now a tribute to both our 26th president and Sheraton Conference Centers. (<em>House Beautiful</em> <a href=\"http://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/news/g4658/white-house-renovation/\">has some more before-and-after photos of the renovation</a>, which showcase the White Houseâs preference for a neutral color palette of taupes and grays, a very on-trend look for the <em>Fixer Upper</em> and West Elm set.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/AlliemalCNN/status/900079397570531328\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AlliemalCNN/status/900079397570531328\">https://twitter.com/AlliemalCNN/status/900079397570531328</a></p></blockquote></div><p>The Oval Office itself received a facelift, swapping out the midcentury modern furniture and curtains for some conspicuously gold-hued upholstery, and replacing <strong>Barack Obamaâs</strong> striped yellow wallpaper with a gray damask print that Trump picked out himself. (The wallpaper itself is temporary and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferJJacobs/status/900408804076113921\">may be changed</a> when Trump picks out a permanent rug; a pragmatic choice for someone <a href=\"http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/banish-bare-walls-even-in-a-rental-10-sources-for-removable-wallpaper-178231\">renting a room</a>.)</p>\n<div class=\"embed block row social-twitter\"><blockquote class=\"embed twitter-embed-component twitter-tweet twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\" data-type=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/KelemenCari/status/900398536461869057\"><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KelemenCari/status/900398536461869057\">https://twitter.com/KelemenCari/status/900398536461869057</a></p></blockquote></div><p>Normally, this would be an uncontroversial process, newsworthy only to <em>HGTV Magazine</em> and <strong>Martha Stewart</strong> acolytes, but in Trumpâs White House, full of leaking and backstabbing and petty feuds, an unnamed source could not resist taking a swipe at his predecessorâs design choices:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>â[Mr. Trump] wanted to bring back the luster and the glory of the White House,â said the White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. âThe Obama wallpaper was very damaged. There were a lot of stains on it,â the official said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This may be the first time in White House history that a White House official has gone on background to discuss something as mundane as a wallpaper refresh.</p>\n<p>Some of the changes were more symbolic than cosmetic. Trump also selected politically relevant pieces of decor to offset his attempt at a muted color palette. He previously raised hackles when he <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/316115-trump-hangs-portrait-of-andrew-jackson-in-oval-office\">chose a portrait of Andrew Jackson</a> to hang in his office, added six extra flags behind his desk, and replaced a bust of Martin Luther King Jr. with one of Winston Churchill, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/01/23/heres-the-real-story-about-the-churchill-bust-in-the-oval-office/?utm_term=.eddc02ce99ad\">complaining</a> that Obama had given the bust back to the British government. (A false story, it turns out.) CBS News noted that Trump had added another touch to the Roosevelt Room: âTwo large, gilded eagles&#8212;acquired by G.S.A.âs West Wing historian at a Maryland antique shopâ&#8212;which now âadorn pedestalsâ in the large West Wing conference room.</p>","channel":"News","subChannel":"Politics","tags":["white house","donald trump","oval office","barack obama","real estate"],"ledeCaption":"","contentSource":"web","canonicalUrl":"","meta":{"collectionName":"articles","modelName":"article","publishable":true,"identifiable":true,"image":false,"archived":false,"hallable":true,"hierarchical":false},"dek":"âHe wanted to bring back the luster and the glory of the White House.â","seoTitle":"Trump Official Praises Oval Office Makeover, Blames Obama for Wallpaper Stains","seoDescription":"âHe wanted to bring back the luster and the glory of the White House.â","socialTitle":"White House Blames Obama for Oval Office Wallpaper Stains","socialDescription":"Trump âwanted to bring back the luster and the glory of the White House.â","issueDate":"","rubric":"Fixer Upper","promoHed":"Trump Official Praises Oval Office Makeover, Blames Obama for Wallpaper Stains","promoDek":"âHe wanted to bring back the luster and the glory of the White House.â","id":"599de4c53d136d69c68beff0","revision":15,"createdAt":"August 23, 2017 4:25 pm","modifiedAt":"August 23, 2017 5:30 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"August 23, 2017 5:30 pm","_links":{},"_embedded":{"photosTout":[{"fields":{"revisionAuthor":"Tina Nguyen","filename":"Obama-Trump-Oval-Office-Stains.jpg","aspectRatios":{"master":{"width":1544,"height":1029,"format":"JPEG","duration":null,"url":"https://cn-copilot-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/vf/production/2017/08/23/599de6350ba28d197bf76856_Obama-Trump-Oval-Office-Stains.jpg"},"3:2":{"override":false,"height":1028,"width":1542,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1028,"width":1542,"x":1,"y":0}},"duration":null},"5:3":{"override":false,"height":924,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":924,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"2:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":686,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":686,"x":429,"y":0}},"duration":null},"9:16":{"override":false,"height":1024,"width":576,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1024,"width":576,"x":484,"y":0}},"duration":null},"7:3":{"override":false,"height":660,"width":1540,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":660,"width":1540,"x":2,"y":0}},"duration":null},"16:9":{"override":false,"height":864,"width":1536,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":864,"width":1536,"x":4,"y":0}},"duration":null},"4:3":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1372,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1372,"x":86,"y":0}},"duration":null},"1:1":{"override":false,"height":1029,"width":1029,"modifications":{"crop":{"height":1029,"width":1029,"x":257.5,"y":0}},"duration":null}},"title":"94096360","credit":"By Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.","cropMode":"TOP","meta":{"collectionName":"photos","modelName":"photo","publishable":false,"identifiable":false,"image":true,"archived":false,"hallable":false,"hierarchical":false},"restrictCropping":false,"id":"599de6350ba28d197bf76857","revision":2,"createdAt":"August 23, 2017 4:31 pm","modifiedAt":"August 23, 2017 4:32 pm","revisionCreatedAt":"August 23, 2017 4:32 pm","tags":[],"altText":"Barack Obama.","description":"Getty;
